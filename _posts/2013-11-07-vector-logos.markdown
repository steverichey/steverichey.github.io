I have a bit of an obsession with high-quality logos.  Ever since I found out how easy it was to work with pure SVGs, I've been using a combination of [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/), [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), and [Peter Collingridge's SVG Editor](http://petercollingridge.appspot.com/svg-editor) to create detailed, high-quality icons for various projects.  Each of the images below is a PNG, but you can click to view or download the SVG of each one.  If you feel your logo has been used inappropriately, feel free to [contact me](index.php?page_id=1520) and I'll work to resolve the issue promptly.

Unless otherwise noted, all SVGs use mostly path objects and have minimal metadata content, resulting in very small files.  However, I did leave some whitespace in the files for readability.

Please note that I **do not** claim to have any right to these images, and they are placed here for your own personal use only! In some cases, I based my work off existing SVG files (the Haxe logo only required a few tweaks), but for others, I created the entire image based on much lower-quality PNGs and JPGs.

As I create new SVGs, I'll update this post.  Enjoy!

(This isn't the current logo for [Neko VM](http://nekovm.org/), but rather a concept for a change that would bring it in line with the Haxe logo.)
