I was taught leadership abilities in the U.S. Navy where I became experienced with Nuclear Energy. Since then, I have expanded my education at Illinois State University (ISU), receiving a Bachelor Degree in Renewable Energy and a Master's in Business Administration. I've gained great experience in research and analysis, project management, economics, and more during my time at ISU and am constantly striving to expand my skillset.

Thanks to a personal interest in programming, I was able to teach myself multiple programming languages including Ruby, Actionscript, Haxe, HTML, Java, and more. I'm a quick learner and very dedicated to my work. I would be happy to hold a position where I can develop innovative solutions to complex problems.
